The Azure portal provides out of the box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps Services, Github, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your drrevelopment machine.
Connect your web app with any of the above sources nd App Service will do the erst for you by auto-syncing code and any future changes on the code into the web app.

You can also run custom linux containers(Also known as Web App for Containers).
